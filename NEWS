synthpop 1.1-1
---------------

CHANGES
* Both variable names and their column indices can be used in `visit.sequence`.
* Arguments `rules`, `rvalues`, `cont.na`, `semicont`, `smoothing`, `event`,
  `denom` are specified as named lists, e.g. rules = list(marital = "age < 18")
  and do not have to be specified for all variables.
* Optional arguments can be passed to synthesising functions by specifying 
  `funname.argname` arguments, e.g. ctree.minbucket = 5; they are 
  function-specific; `minbucket` removed from arguments.  
* Smoothing is possible for numeric variables when synthesised with the method 
  'sample'.
* compare() is a generic function with two methods (for class `synds` and 
  `fit.synds`); it replaced two separate functions.   
* New argument `return.plot` for compare() method for class `fit.synds`.
* New argument `msel` for compare() method for class `synds`, which 
  allows comparison for pooled or selected data set(s). Results for multiple
  synthetic data sets can be plotted on the same graph. 
* New argument `nrow` for compare() method for class `synds`; `nrow`
  and `ncol` determine number of plots per screen.
* Argument `plot.na` for compare() method for class `synds` is no longer 
  required and missing data categories for numeric variables are ploted 
  on the same plot as non-missing values. 
* Argument `object` of lm.synds() and glm.synds() functions changed to `data`. 
* print() method for class `fit.synds` gives by default combined coefficient 
  estimates only.
* summary() method for class `fit.synds` gives combined coefficient 
  estimates and their standard errors.
* summary() method for class `synds` with multiple synthetic data sets 
  provides by default summaries that are calculated by averaging summary 
  values for all synthetic data copies.
* Argument `obs.data` of compare.fit.synds() function changed to `data`. 
* Method `surv.ctree` and `cart.bboot` changed to `survctree` and `cartbboot`.

BUG FIXES
* `denom` and `event` for variables with missing data.
* `maxfaclevels` can be increased.
* Continuous variables with missing data when zero is a non-missing value.
* Synthesis of a single variable (with or without auxiliary predictors) now 
  works.


synthpop 1.1-0
---------------

NEW FEATURES
* Function sdc() for statistical disclosure control of the synthesised data 
  set(s); function replicated.uniques() to determine which unique units in the 
  synthesised data set(s) replicates unique units in the original data set.    
* Function read.obs() to import original data sets form external files.
* Function write.syn() to export synthetic data sets to external files and 
  create a text file with information about the synthesis.
* syn() has new `semicont` parameter that allows to define spike(s) 
  for semi-continuous variables in order to synthesise them seperately.
* `lognorm`, `sqrtnorm` and `cubertnorm` methods for synthesis by linear 
  regression after natural logarithm, square root or cube root transformation 
  of a dependent variable.  
* `seed` argument for syn() function.

CHANGES
* Revised output of summary.fit.synds() and compare.fit.synds(); 
  standard errors of Z scores corrected (se(Z.syn)) 
  (thanks to Joerg Drechsler).
* Figures for compare.fit.synds() and compare.synds() functions plotted 
  using ggplot2 functions.  
* period.separated or alllowercase naming convention has been adopted and 
  parameter names `populationInference`, `visitSequence`, `predictorMatrix`,
  `contNA`, `defaultMethod`, `printFlag` and `nlevelmax` have been changed to
  `population.inference`, `visit.sequence`, `predictor.matrix`, `cont.na`,
  `default.method`, `print.flag` and `minnumlevels` respectively.
* Default for drop.pred.only changed to FALSE.

BUG FIXES
* Rounding procedure (thanks to bug report by Joerg Drechsler).
* Warning about extra disregarded argument `family` in compare.fit.synds().
